## Neural Architectures for Biological Inter-Sentence Relation Extraction

### Overview

This website hosts the code and the corpus associated to the [paper](tbd) presented at [SDU@AAAI 22](https://sites.google.com/view/sdu-aaai22/cfp?authuser=0)

### Corpus

The dataset used for this project is an extension of the dataset published by [Noriega et al. 2018](https://ml4ai.github.io/BioContext/). The original corpus contains hand curated annotations with text spans for biochemical events and biological context.

We extend this corpus with full text tokenized aligned to the original annotations to be make it compatible with neural network encoder architectures.

The data files can be downlodaded (here)[https://ml4ai.github.io/BioContext/] and the parsing code is locatede (here)[https://ml4ai.github.io/BioContext/]

### Code

The implementation of the neural architectures to detect biocontext can be found [here](https://github.com/enoriega/NeuralInterSentenceBioRelationExtraction/).
